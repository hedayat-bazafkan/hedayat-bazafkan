# 👋 Hi, I'm Hedayat Bazafkan, you can call me Hed.

I am a fintech systems designer focused on ultra-low-latency trading, crypto market-making, and exchange-grade infrastructure. I work extensively with Python, NodeJs and RUST, building high-performance trading engines, real-time market-data pipelines, and execution systems optimized for microsecond-level performance. My work spans HFT architecture, order-book systems, FIX/WebSocket gateway design, and latency-sensitive algorithmic execution across major digital-asset venues.

I am passionate about **blockchain, DeFi, Web3, and trading systems**. in general

Currently, I work at **KuCoin Exchange** as an **API & Trading Systems Developer**, supporting algorithmic traders and building tools for strategy validation and monitoring, developing SDKs and helping HFT and MM cleints to overcome their trading issue and also working on connectors for exchanges.

I am actively expanding my expertise in **quant trading and HFT system development**, alongside with DeFi and Dex trading systems.
